## Data collection

The ‘WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition’ dataset has been used for this project, which contains a total of 35 variables and 1470 valid observations related to demographic attributes of employees, organisational departments, job satisfaction, job involvement and attrition. Missing values in the dataset have been checked using the ‘COUNTBLANK’ function in Excel from which the observed null values for variables are 0, indicating data consistency for further analysis.

## Critical analysis and justification of dashboard solution

**Figure 2: Employee attrition**

The pie chart in Figure 6 provides information related to percentage of employee attrition within the organisation, which can allow HR managers to measure severity of employee attrition or the extent of turnover intention among the employees. The selection of pie charts is justified due to the categorical nature of gender (two categories: male and female). From Figure 2, it can be observed that 16.12% of employees have shown attrition, whereas 83.88% of employees have shown no attrition, indicating low level of turnover intention among the employees. This may be due to high levels of workplace engagement and satisfaction among employees, which can be a result of effective leadership strategies imposed by the organisation.

**Figure 3: Employee attrition across different age groups**

Age of the employees can have a substantial influence on their turnover intention; thus, age management can be an essential part of strategic human resource management. This signifies the importance of evaluating employee attrition across age groups for HR managers. The distribution of attrition across different age groups has been presented using bar charts as bar charts allow to effectively show the distribution of a categorical variable (with multiple categories. The grouping of age has been performed by selecting grouping options under the pivot table with a bin size of 9. From Figure 3, it can be observed that employee attrition is substantially higher across the age groups of 28-37 years (638) and 38-47 years (406), which may be due to employees in middle-aged groups having better job switching opportunities than young adults or older population.

**Figure 4: Employee attrition across gender**

Gender-wise distribution of employee attrition has been presented by using a doughnut chart, which can be essential for the HR manager to evaluate turnover intention across males and females. From Figure 4, it can be observed that employee attrition is considerably higher among male employees (60%) compared to female employees (40%). This may be due to male employees having a low level of job involvement and workplace engagement, which has led to higher turnover. Thus, HR managers can focus on introducing employee engagement programs for male employees to enhance job involvement and reduce employee turnover.

**Figure 5: Employee attrition across departments**

By using a multiple bar chart, distribution of employee attrition across departments segmented by age groups has been presented to provide insights related to attrition across departments and age groups as a whole. The consideration of two attributes (departments and age groups) for showing attrition has justified selection of a stacked bar chart (Refer to Figure 9). From Figure 5, it can be observed that employee attrition across the research and development (R&D) department is considerably higher than in departments like sales and human resources. This indicates that work pressure may be substantially higher in the R & D department or employees may have better job opportunities in R&D. Thus, HR managers can introduce attractive incentivisation programs to enhance workplace loyalty among employees in R&D departments.

**Figure 6: Employee attrition across income level of the employees**

Horizontal bar chart (Figure 6) has been used to show distribution of attrition across income levels, which can provide insights regarding the impact of economic condition of employees on turnover intention. Income level can have a substantial impact on employee turnover, as employees having low salaries always show higher turnover than employees with higher salaries (Jain, Jain and Pamula, 2020). From Figure 10, it can be observed that employees in the low-income level (1009-6008) have shown comparatively high attrition.

**Figure 7: Variation in attrition based on the education level of employees**

Through the use of a horizontal bar chart, distribution of employee attrition across education levels and genders has been presented, which can provide insights regarding the variations of employee attrition across different education levels, allowing HR managers to identify at which education level, employees have shown higher attrition. From Figure 7, it can be observed that across education level 3 and 4 employees (both males and females) have shown higher attrition, which may be due to better employment opportunities or mismatch in job role expectations of employees.

**Figure 8: Effect of job satisfaction and job involvement on employee attrition**

The stacked bar chart in Figure 8 presents the job satisfaction and job involvement for employees with attrition and employees without attrition, providing insights into variations in job involvement and satisfaction in terms of turnover intention. From Figure 8, it can be observed that job satisfaction (2.77) and job involvement (2.78) are comparatively higher among employees without attrition compared to those with attrition. This signifies that lower job involvement and lower job satisfaction have led to higher turnover for the company.

# Conclusion and recommendations
1.	Development of targeted retention strategies specifically aimed at middle-aged employees (28-47 years) can be essential for the company to improve retention among employees in the middle age group. In this context, incorporation of career development opportunities (Job shadowing for a higher job position, networking events), mentoring programs and clear road map for promotion can enhance trust and loyalty among the employees.
2. HR managers can focus on improving the work environment, fostering a positive organisational culture, and providing opportunities for meaningful work to enhance job satisfaction and involvement among employees.
3. The implication of tracking performance metrics (like absenteeism and objective management) related to employee turnover and employee retention from the dashboard can be essential for HR managers to gain detailed insights regarding the level of job satisfaction and job involvement among employees. This can allow them to make strategic decisions regarding deployment of effective strategies related to career development programs and workplace engagement programs.
